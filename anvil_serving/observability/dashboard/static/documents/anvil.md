---

Anvil is a local-first state layer that lets multiple AI coding agents — and
the humans working alongside them — execute the same plan without overwriting
each other. It records requirements, tasks, claims, and evidence in SQLite, and
exposes them through a CLI (`anvil`) and an MCP server that any harness (Claude
Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, …) can drive.

Two ideas separate it from an issue tracker:

- **Claims are enforced, not conventional.** A claim is a database row with a
  lease and heartbeat — single-winner coordination that holds across sessions,
  parallel loops, and machines, not "assign a label and hope."
- **Status is downstream of proof.** Completion is evidence-gated: agents submit
  typed proofs, reviews gate acceptance, and every accepted task mints a signed,
  replayable `AcceptanceProof` you can verify off-host.

> **Beta — v0.6.5.** The core loop is stable and dogfooded; some command
> surfaces may change before 1.0.

## What changed in v0.6.5

- **Revision-safe PRDs** — review, approval, planning, and new claims bind the
  exact source revision ([#180](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/180),
  [#192](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/192)).
- **Transactional Git claims** — branch/worktree setup now commits completely
  or rolls claim state back cleanly ([#180](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/180)).
- **Versioned provider reads** — bounded project snapshots and PRD content are
  available without internal-database coupling
  ([#178](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/178)).
- **Safer task routing** — PRD scope, strict 1-5 risk ceilings, and actor review
  history agree across CLI and MCP ([#56](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/56),
  [#109](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/109)).
- **Faster Windows tests** — the maintained parallel suite and focused contract
  slice run without UAC or junction-dependent collection
  ([#118](https://github.com/fakoli/anvil/issues/118)).

See the [v0.6.5 changelog](CHANGELOG.md#065---2026-08-24) for the complete
release-candidate-to-release history and related fixes.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install anvil-state      # installs the `anvil` CLI + `anvil-mcp` server
anvil install <harness>          # wire anvil into Codex, Cursor, VS Code, …
```

Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are the only requirements.
Upgrading or uninstalling later? See
[Upgrading and uninstalling](https://fakoli.github.io/anvil/how-to/getting-started/#upgrading-and-uninstalling).

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install (Claude Code plugin · one-line script · from source)</summary>

**As a Claude Code plugin** — registers the hooks, MCP server, and agents:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add fakoli/anvil
/plugin install anvil@anvil
```

**One-line harness setup** (installs `anvil-state`, then runs `anvil install`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fakoli/anvil/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- <harness>
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fakoli/anvil.git && cd anvil/bin
uv sync && uv run anvil --help
```

For MCP clients without an in-place writer, `anvil mcp-config <client>` prints a
paste-ready config block.

</details>

## Development

Run the same locked lint gate as CI from the source checkout:

```bash
cd bin
uv sync --locked --extra custom
uv run --locked ruff check ..
cd ..
uv run --project bin pytest
```

## Quick start

```bash
anvil init --with-sample     # seed a runnable sample project
anvil next                   # → the next ready task, immediately
anvil claim T001             # lease it; a git branch is created for the work
anvil packet T001            # the exact intent, acceptance criteria, and scope
anvil submit T001 --commands "pytest" --files-changed src/foo.py
anvil apply T001 --approve   # evidence-gated → done, with a signed proof
```

That is the whole loop. The
**[getting-started guide](https://fakoli.github.io/anvil/how-to/getting-started/)**
walks through it on your own PRD.

## What you get

- **A canonical plan, not free-form text.** PRDs parse into validated tasks
  scored across six dimensions (complexity, parallelizability, context load,
  blast radius, review risk, agent suitability) that drive routing. Optional
  typed assumptions remain visible through planning and execution, while
  `anvil prd assess` gives advisory, testability-focused feedback before design.
- **Work packets built for agents.** `anvil packet T012` renders exact intent,
  acceptance criteria, and non-goals — no summarizing an issue thread.
- **A tamper-evident audit trail.** Every mutation appends to an event log;
  replaying it reconstructs the database — an invariant checked in CI.
- **Runtime-neutral by design.** The CLI and MCP server aren't coupled to any
  one agent runtime, and multi-PRD projects, GitHub Issues sync, and
  multi-provider LLM planning (Anthropic · Bedrock · OpenAI-compatible) all ship
  today.

## Anvil vs. an issue tracker

| | Anvil | GitHub Issues / markdown-file conventions |
|---|---|---|
| **State shape** | Pydantic models in SQLite, validated at every transition | Free-form markdown in an issue body or `.md` file |
| **Coordination** | `Claim` row with lease + heartbeat; stale leases reaped at coordination entry points | Assignment-by-label — no enforcement |
| **Agent hand-off** | Rendered work packet: intent, criteria, non-goals | Agent summarizes the whole thread |
| **Completion** | Evidence-gated; signed, replayable proof | Trust the "done" checkbox |
| **Context cost** | Measured ~2.4k always-on tokens ([audit](benchmarks/CONTEXT_AUDIT.md)) | Whole threads enter context on demand |

## Proven in real sessions

Numbers from recorded working sessions
([post-session-findings](https://github.com/fakoli/post-session-findings)), not
projections:

- **32 tasks, 21 PRs, and a release from one 23.7-hour autonomous session** —
  the loop stayed coherent across 28M generated tokens under ~2 dozen human
  messages.
- **Two concurrent agent loops finished an 18/18-task PRD in 16.7 hours** — the
  lease model deconflicted both sessions with zero explicit negotiation (in the
  [benchmark](benchmarks/RESULTS.md), file collisions dropped 3.0 → 0.0 vs. a
  shared-markdown control).
- **The review gates catch real defects every time they run** — a fail-open deny
  gate, log-injection bugs, and a semantically broken "clean" merge, each caught
  before it shipped.

## Status

Beta (v0.6.5). The full PRD → plan → claim → execute → verify → finish loop
works today, alongside GitHub Issues sync and multi-provider LLM support.
Near-term focus is provider expansion, usability, and remaining pre-1.0
contract hardening; Linear/Monday providers and webhook sync are on the
[roadmap](https://fakoli.github.io/anvil/roadmap/).
